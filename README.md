* Title: Vox Pupuli  - Managing 150 git repositories and contributions at scale

Managing a single FOSS project is hard. You get a ton of of emails from GitHub
issues, contributions and people asking for new releases. And every other month
your build pipeline fails because one of your project's dependencies introduced
a breaking change. Now think about the amount of issues you would have with
multiple repos! Vox Pupuli, the community managing over 100 Puppet modules and
over 150 git repositories, developed some tooling and best practices to handle
the huge amount of repositories and contributions. We would like to introduce
you to our way of organizing a FOSS community and share some funny stories
about the issues and outages that forced us to develop and improve our tooling.
